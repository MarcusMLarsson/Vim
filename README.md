  <p> Controll panel => security => advanced settings => environment variables. <br> <br>
  each environment value has NAME = VALUE. Point of variable is communicate to programs how the machine is setup and 
  sometimes to control the behaviour of programs. PATH variable tells my computer were to look for executeable programs. 
  If I put my program in this directory, I can run it from anywhere without typing the path to the program. That's why I can type dirr in terminal for instance?
